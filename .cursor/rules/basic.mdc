# IMPORTANT:
- emphasize modularity (multiple files) and discourage a monolith (one giant file) in javascript.
- Always read docs/game-design-document.md before writing any code.
- Document code with comments.
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized  
- Avoid having files over 200–300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
- do not update any .env by yourself, always ask before updating .env
-  do not make unnecessary md files
